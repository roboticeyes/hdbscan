# HDBSCAN - Density Clustering Algorithm

HDBSCAN algorithm implementation in golang.

Written to run concurrently on CPU (uses all CPU cores by default).

A re-write of code started by the brilliant developer Edouard Belval at https://github.com/Belval/hdbscan  ... although it has changed quite a lot from the original.

## Download

`go get -u github.com/humilityai/hdbscan`

## Use

```go
import(
    "github.com/humilityai/hdbscan"
)

func main() {
    data := [][]float64{
        []float64{1,2,3},
        []float64{3,2,1},
    }
    minimumClusterSize := len(data)
    minimumSpanningTree := true

    // create
    clustering, err := hdbscan.NewClustering(data, minimumClusterSize)
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }

    // options
    clustering = clustering.Verbose().OutlierDetection()

    //run
    clustering.Run(hdbscan.EuclideanDistance, hdbscan.VarianceScore, minimumSpanningTree)

    // If using sampling, then can use the Assign() method afterwards on the total dataset.
}
```

### options

- `Verbose()` will log the progress of the clustering to stdout.
- `Voronoi()` will add all points not placed in a cluster in the final clustering to their nearest cluster. All unassigned data points outliers will be added to their nearest cluster.
- `OutlierDetection()` will mark all unassigned data points as outliers of their nearest cluster and provide a `NormalizedDistance` value for each outlier that can be interpreted as the probability that the data point is an outlier of that cluster.
- `NearestNeighbor()` specifies if an unassigned points "nearness" to a cluster should be based on it's nearest assigned neighboring data point in that cluster (default "nearness" is based on distance to centroid of cluster).
- `Subsample(n int)` specifies to only use the first `n` data points in the clustering process. This speeds up the clustering. The remaining data points can be added to clusters using the `Assign(data [][]float64)` method after a successful clustering.
- `OutlierClustering()` will create a new cluster for the outliers of an existing cluster if the number of outliers is equal to or greater than the specified minimum-cluster-size.
